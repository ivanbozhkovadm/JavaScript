<div>Mini-mathematica

Write a program that properly computes mathematical expressions over the following operations and functions:<br><br>

arithmetic - addition, substraction, negation, multiplication, division<br>
advanced - exponentiation, nth root, logarithms<br>
trigonometric - sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent<br>
You should also include support for common constants such as pi and e.<br><br>

One example expression would be:<br><br>

5 + sin(pi) / pow(2, 10) - log(e, pow(e, sqrt(4)))<br><br>
Your program should output 3 on the example above.<br>

Use shunting yard and reverse polish notation.</div>
